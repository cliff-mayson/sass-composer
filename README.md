[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/digitaledgeit/sass-composer.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/digitaledgeit/sass-composer) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/digitaledgeit/sass-composer/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/digitaledgeit/sass-composer?branch=master)

Compose CSS from SASS files using Node's algorithm to resolve `@import`s. Plus more goodness.

####  Why not [component](https://github.com/componentjs/component) or [rework-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rework-npm)?

Because `component` and `rework-npm` don't use SASS, and SASS makes it easy to keep your styles semantic and DRY.

#### Why not [duo](http://duojs.org/), or [sassify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sassify)?

Because with `duo` and `sassify` your SASS/SCSS/CSS can't use variables, functions, mixins or extend classes defined in one module from another module.

Because with `sassify` you must require your SASS in your JS files. `sass-composer` builds a separate CSS file.

## Installation

    npm install --save sass-composer

## Usage

Write some SASS:

```scss
//import SASS/SCSS/CSS files from an external NPM module
@import "normalize";
@import "sass-breakpoints";

//import SASS/SCSS/CSS files from the local NPM module
@import "./fonts"

//you can use the $__dirname and $__filename variables in each imported file

//by default, assets url('./img/my-asset.png') will be copied into the destination directory

//now go write some more SASS...
@include breakpoint('xs') {
  .foo { content: "bar" }
}
```

Compose CSS using the CLI:

    sass-composer index.scss -o index.css

Compose CSS using the API:

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var path = require('path');
var composer = require('sass-composer');

var input   = __dirname+'/index.scss';
var output  = __dirname+'/build/build.css';

composer()
  .entry(input)
  .use(composer.plugins.url({dir: path.dirname(output), copy: true}))
  .compose(function(err, css, stats) {
    if (err) return console.error(err);
    fs.writeFile(output, css, function() {
      if (err) return console.error('Error writing file "'+input+'": \n', err.message);
      console.log('Composed "'+path.basename(input)+'" to "'+path.basename(output)+'".');
    });
  })
;
```

## CLI

    sass-composer <file> [options]
    
- `<file>` - The entry file (SASS/SCSS/CSS) 
- `-o` `--output` - The output path (optional)
- `-w` `--watch` - Watch for changes to the input files and re-compose whenever a file is changed (optional)

## API

### Methods

#### new Composer(options)

Create a new composer.

#### .entry(file)

Set the path of the entry file.

#### .compose([callback]) : Stream

Compose CSS from SASS.
  
#### .importer(fn)

Add an importer. 

The importer function is called for each `@import` statement. It is passed:

- a context object containing :
    - the `.entry` filename, 
    - the `.parent` filename, 
    - the `.file` filename 
    - and optionally the file `.contents`
- a `done` callback 

For example: import files from `./bower_components/`

```js
composer.importer(function(ctx, done) {
  var bower_path = './bower_components/'+ctx.file;
  
  //if the file already exists then leave it as-is
  if (fs.existsSync(ctx.file)) {
    done(null, ctx);
  }
    
  //if the file exists in the bower_components directory then rewrite the filename
  if (fs.existsSync(bower_path)) {
    ctx.file = bower_path;
    done(null, ctx);
  } 

});
```

#### .function(dfn, fn)

Add a SASS function.

For example: return the sum of two numbers

```js
composer.function('sum($a, $b)', function(a, b) {
  return this.types.Number(a.getValue()+b.getValue());
});
```

#### .use(fn)

Use a plugin. Plugins are simple functions and are called on composer instance. 
  
## Importers

### node

Resolve `@import`s according to Node's resolve algorithm. Will resolve SASS, SCSS and CSS files, their dependencies and dependencies of dependencies... you get the point.

### once

Prevent files from being imported multiple times. Waiting on a [node-sass bugfix](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/894)

### fs-loader

Load the file's contents.

### pathname

Prepend and append `$__dirname` and `$__dirname` variables to each file.

## Functions

None as of yet. Go write one!
  
## Plugins
  
### url

Transform URLs. 

The default setting rewrites and copies URLs relative to the entry file e.g. `../img/logo.png` in  `./scss/_brand.scss` imported from `index.scss` gets re-written as `img/logo.png`.

You can write your own transforms to do whatever you want e.g. inline images using datauri, rewrite URLs to a CDN, append a cache busting string etc

## Known issues

- there is no check for different versions of the same module (in JS conflicts are prevented by wraping the modules in anonymous scopes - which do not exist in CSS)

## TODO

- Composer.watch() API
- accept node-sass sass formatting options
- sync and async importers, functions and URL processors
- write way more tests
- handling version conflicts?
